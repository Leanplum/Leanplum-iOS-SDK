## Submitting changes

Please consider following guidelines before creating a PR:

- Confirm the intention and design of your change by reaching out to your Customer Success Manager or to Leanplum Dev Team through a new Github Issue.
- Start creating your pull request from `develop` branch
- Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).  
- Add unit tests for the code that you have touched.
- Please follow the existing coding conventions (which are mostly standard of the default IDE).
- Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
- Please adhere to the conventional changelog commit style: https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli That allows us to easily create change logs.
