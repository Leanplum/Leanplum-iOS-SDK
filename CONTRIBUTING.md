# How to Contribute

While our SDKs are open source, we currently do **NOT** accept any feature request PRs. 
In some rare cases, we may accept bug fixes but there is absolutely no commitment or expectation for that and you should not rely on that in any way.
If you want to request a feature or report a bug, please contact Leanplum Support.

Here are some important resources:

  * [Leanplum Docs](http://leanplum.com/docs) The official Leanplum docs.
  * Leanplum Support: Get help at support@leanplum.com.

## Submitting changes

Please consider following guidelines before creating a PR:

- Confirm the intention and design of your change by reaching out to your Customer Success Manager.
- Start creating your pull request from `master` branch
- Please send a GitHub Pull Request with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)).  
- Add unit tests for the code that you have touched.
- Please follow the existing coding conventions (which are mostly standard of the default IDE).
- Make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit).
- Please adhere to the conventional changelog commit style: https://github.com/commitizen/cz-cli That allows us to easily create change logs.
